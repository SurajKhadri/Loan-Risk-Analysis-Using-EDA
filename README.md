Introduction:
This assignment provides practical application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real business context. It aims to develop an understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services, focusing on minimizing the risk of financial loss while lending to customers.

Business Understanding:
Working for a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers, the challenge is to assess loan applications effectively. The company faces the dilemma of approving loans to applicants with insufficient credit history, risking defaults, or rejecting potentially viable applicants. The data provides insights into payment patterns and applicant profiles, categorizing clients into those with payment difficulties and those who pay on time.

Decision Scenarios:
Four possible decisions arise during loan applications:

Approved: The company approves the loan application.

Cancelled: The client cancels the application, sometimes due to changed circumstances or unfavorable pricing.

Refused: The company rejects the loan due to client's non-compliance with requirements.

Unused Offer: The client cancels the loan at different stages of the process.

Business Objectives:
The primary objective is to identify patterns indicating payment difficulties. These patterns will inform strategic decisions such as loan denial, reduced loan amounts, or higher interest rates for riskier applicants. By understanding the driving factors behind loan default, the company aims to avoid rejecting credit-worthy applicants. This case study employs EDA to recognize variables strongly indicative of default, aiding the company's portfolio management and risk assessment strategies. Prior research in risk analytics is encouraged to enhance domain understanding.
